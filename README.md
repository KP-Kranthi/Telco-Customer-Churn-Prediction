# Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Customer turnover is the corporate issue we want predictive analytics to help with. Churn
is the result of consumers stopping to deal with a company. Retaining current consumers is
usually more affordable for companies than attracting new ones. Predicting turnover so enables
businesses to pinpoint which consumers could be prone to leave. This will help them to be
proactive in improving retention, raising client happiness, and generating income while lowering
the expenses of customer acquisition. In subscription-based businesses where continuous
relationships and long-term income sources are vital, addressing turnover is extremely important.

**Goal: **
This project aims to create a prediction model based on consumer data to find which
clients most likely will leave. Using past data will enable us to forecast future turnover and
support the company in acting pro-early. Improved client retention, lower turnover rates, and
generally greater company results will follow from this.

**How predictive analysis helps the Business**
By means of analysis of the elements influencing customer behaviour and identification
of the patterns linked with turnover, predictive analytics can help solve the churn issue.
Predictive models like Decision Trees or K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) can categorize
consumers into those likely to churn and those who will remain loyal by analyzing data such
tenure, contract type, monthly expenses, and customer support contacts.
For instance, the given analysis's Decision Tree model attained an accuracy of over 79%,
meaning that it can rather fairly forecast whether a customer is going to leave.
Early identification of at-risk consumers made possible by predictive analytics allows the
organization to use loyalty programs, customer service enhancements, or focused incentives to
keep them, hence lowering turnover and increasing general profitability.
